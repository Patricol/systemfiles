* DO BEFORE STARTING:
  * BACKUP HOME FOLDERS
    * move excess files from /home folders onto nas before doing this
      * likely delete cache folders
    * sudo baobab to check other folders for important things.
      * VM images can be created outside of /home automatically etc.
    * close all programs so chrome etc aren't in use.
    * sudo tar -cvf /arch-homes.tar /home/
    * move the backup onto the nas etc.
  * CHECK THAT THE SYSTEMFILES REPO IS UP TO DATE AND PUSHED ETC.
    * re-run save-system-info and push the updated package lists
  * CHECK THAT DUPLICACY HAS A RECENT BACKUP
    * http://localhost:3875
  * RUN WITH ONLY ONE SSD/HDD CONNECTED
    * AND ONLY IF THE ENTIRE SSD/HDD CAN BE USED
